# JS Memory Game with a focus on accessibility
This project was produced for the Founders and Coders application in Spring 2023. In reponse for a basic game to be made in javascript, it uses a basic framework for a memory card game, and tries to develop javascript responses to the lack of accessibility for most Javascript games. This includes the creation of aria and tabindex labels in objects that are created in the DOM, the use of Tab, Enter and Arrow keys as well as mousevents to navigate the game. 


It has been tested with JAWS screenreader software, with adjustments for "polite" for more passive information, and "assertive" for feeding back the focused cards. Tests using any other screen readers are intended, and any feedback from users is additionally welcomed and encouraged.
